</p>

	EVA-Mind is an artificial intelligence system for healthcare.
	It was created by Jose R F Junior on June 2, 2025.

	EVA stands for "Entidade Virtual de Apoio" (Virtual Support Entity).
	The system provides real-time voice assistance, clinical decision
	support, and persistent memory through a combination of graph
	databases, vector search, and large language models.

	This is NOT a chatbot. EVA has her own identity, her own memory,
	and her own personality that evolves with every interaction. She
	remembers. She learns. She adapts.


WHAT IS EVA-MIND
----------------

	EVA-Mind is the brain behind EVA. It handles:

	- Real-time bidirectional voice via WebSocket (Gemini Live API)
	- Real-time camera and screen analysis for medical assistance
	- Patient memory graphs (Neo4j) with Hebbian learning
	- Semantic memory search (Qdrant vector database)
	- Krylov subspace compression (1536D -> 64D, ~97% precision)
	- Psychoanalytic context modeling (Lacanian framework)
	- Personality system (Big Five + Enneagram) with evolution
	- Clinical scales (PHQ-9, GAD-7, C-SSRS) via voice
	- Voice prosody analysis (depression, anxiety, Parkinson detection)
	- Medication scheduling, alerting, and visual identification
	- Emergency detection, escalation, and crisis prediction
	- Multi-agent swarm with circuit breaker routing
	- REM-inspired memory consolidation with selective replay
	- Global Workspace Theory consciousness model
	- FHIR R4 interoperability and MCP server
	- Multi-language support (30+ languages)

	The system currently serves two deployments:

	1. Elderly care (original) - Voice calls via Twilio for
	   medication reminders, psychological support, and crisis
	   detection with caregiver escalation.

	2. Malaria detection (Angola) - Real-time voice and camera
	   assistance for healthcare workers diagnosing malaria
	   from microscope images.

	                          injection, and function calling support.

	Both are actively used. They are not duplicates.


MEMORY SYSTEM
-------------

	EVA's memory is inspired by neuroscience. It has multiple layers:

	1. Episodic Memory (PostgreSQL + Qdrant)
	   - Per-patient conversation history
	   - Stored as text with vector embeddings (1536D)
	   - Timestamped, importance-scored, emotion-tagged
	   - Retrieved by semantic similarity + recency + importance

	2. Semantic Memory (Neo4j knowledge graphs)
	   - Per-patient knowledge graphs
	   - Medical conditions, medications, family, preferences
	   - Entities extracted and linked automatically
	   - Hebbian edge strengthening on co-activation

	3. FDPN Network (Spreading Activation)
	   - Anderson (1983) spreading activation model
	   - Nodes activate neighbors based on edge weights
	   - Primed by personality weights and situational context
	   - Redis cache for performance (<10ms latency)

	4. Hebbian Learning
	   - Real-time: updates weights after every retrieval query
	     (eta=0.01, lambda=0.001, tau=86400s)
	   - Consolidation: batch strengthening during REM cycles
	   - Dual plasticity: Zenke & Gerstner (2017) model

	5. REM Consolidation
	   - Sleep-inspired memory consolidation pipeline
	   - Hot episodic memories -> selective replay -> spectral
	     clustering -> Krylov centroid -> semantic Neo4j node
	   - Prunes redundant memories, creates abstractions
	   - Science: Rasch & Born (2013), Tadros et al. (2022)

	6. Krylov Subspace Compression
	   - Compresses 1536D embeddings to 64D (~97% precision)
	   - Rank-1 updates with Modified Gram-Schmidt
	   - Sliding window FIFO for continuous learning
	   - HTTP bridge on port 50052 for external access

	7. EVA's Own Memory (Neo4j port 7688)
	   - EvaSelf node with Big Five personality traits
	   - CoreMemory nodes from post-session reflection
	   - MetaInsight nodes from cross-session pattern detection
	   - All data anonymized, no PII
	   - Personality evolves based on cumulative experience

	8. Synaptogenesis
	   - Automatic edge creation via preferential attachment
	   - Triadic closure and homophily
	   - Science: Bullmore & Sporns (2012), Holtmaat & Svoboda (2009)

	9. Spaced Repetition
	   - Optimized recall scheduling for important memories

	10. Topological Analysis
	    - Persistent homology for memory graph structure


CONTEXT PIPELINE
----------------

	For each voice session, EVA's context is assembled from
	multiple sources in parallel:

	1. Lacanian analysis of the user's speech
	   - Demand vs. desire detection
	   - Signifier chain extraction
	   - Narrative shift detection
	   - Grand Autre transference analysis
	2. Medical context from Neo4j (conditions, medications)
	3. Patient metadata from PostgreSQL (name, language, persona)
	4. Scheduled medications from agendamentos table
	5. Recent episodic memories (last 15 turns, 7-day window)
	6. Semantic signifier chains from Qdrant
	7. Therapeutic stories from wisdom knowledge base
	8. Situational context (time of day, recent events, stressors)
	9. Personality modulation (Big Five + Enneagram + situation)
	10. EVA's own memories (anonymized cross-patient insights)

	All of this is merged into a single system instruction
	sent to the Gemini WebSocket API.


AUTONOMOUS AGENT
----------------

	EVA is a full autonomous agent comparable to OpenClaw. She can
	perceive, decide, and act across platforms without human
	intervention. All capabilities are voice-activated and
	non-blocking (goroutine + WebSocket notification pattern).

	capabilities without requiring a rebuild or restart.

	All autonomous agent tools are gated behind debug mode
	(ENVIRONMENT=development) for safety during testing.

--------------

	EVA can execute clinical tools via Gemini function calling:

	get_vitals             - Retrieve patient vital signs
	                         (blood pressure, glucose, heart rate,

	change_user_directive  - Change language, voice, or mode
	                         in real-time


PREDICTION ENGINE
-----------------

	EVA predicts patient trajectories using:

	- Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) sampling
	- Bayesian networks for crisis probability
	- Monte Carlo trajectory simulation

	Predictions include:

	- 7-day and 30-day crisis probability
	- 30-day hospitalization probability
	- 90-day treatment dropout probability
	- 7-day fall risk probability
	- Projected PHQ-9 scores
	- Medication adherence forecasting

	Input features: PHQ-9, GAD-7, medication adherence,
	sleep hours, social isolation days, voice energy score,
	days since last crisis.


SWARM SYSTEM
------------

	EVA uses a multi-agent swarm architecture:

	- Orchestrator routes tool calls to specialized agents
	- Registry maps tool names to responsible agents
	- Circuit breaker protects against cascading failures
	  (opens after 5 failures, resets after 30 seconds)
	- Priority-based timeouts:
	  Critical: 2s, High: 5s, Medium: 10s, Low: 15s

	Agent types:
	  clinical      - Medical decision support
	  educator      - Patient education
	  emergency     - Crisis protocols and escalation
	  entertainment - Distraction and leisure
	  external      - External API calls
	  google        - Google services (Calendar, Maps, etc.)
	  kids          - Pediatric conversation mode
	  legal         - Legal compliance (LGPD, data rights)
	  productivity  - Task management
	  wellness      - Wellness monitoring


CONSCIOUSNESS MODEL
-------------------

	EVA implements Baars' Global Workspace Theory (1988):

	- Multiple cognitive modules process input in parallel
	- Each module bids for attention (confidence score)
	- Attention spotlight selects the winner
	- Winner is broadcast to all modules
	- Integrated insight merges all interpretations

	Attention system has six components:
	- Affect stabilizer (emotional regulation)
	- Confidence gate (threshold filtering)
	- Executive attention (top-down control)
	- Pattern interrupt (novelty detection)
	- Triple attention (three-stream processing)
	- Wavelet attention (multi-scale analysis)

		{"type": "text",   "text": "<message>"}
		{"type": "config", "text": "<system prompt override>"}

	Server -> Browser:

		{"type": "audio",  "data": "<base64 PCM 24kHz>"}
		{"type": "text",   "text": "<transcription>"}
		{"type": "text",   "text": "<transcription>", "data": "user"}
